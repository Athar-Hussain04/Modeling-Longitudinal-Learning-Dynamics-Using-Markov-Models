# Modeling-Longitudinal-Learning-Dynamics-Using-Markov-Models
This project focuses on analyzing and modeling how students’ learning behaviors evolve over time using Markov Models. A Markov Model is a statistical tool that represents a system of states and transitions, where the probability of moving to the next state depends only on the current state, not on the previous sequence of events.
